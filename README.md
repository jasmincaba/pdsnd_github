### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Using data provided by **Motivate**, a bike share system provider in US, we'll provide some insights in bike share usage. Bike sharing systems are very popular in many cities across the world. These systems allow users to rent a bike for short period of time.

In this project we will investigate data from three cities in US: Chicago, New York City and Washington

### Files used

Files used in project:
 - chicago.csv
 - washington.csv
 - new_york_city.csv

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year
